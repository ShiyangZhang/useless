# Preconditioners-and-Their-Analyses-for-Edge-Element-Saddle-point-Systems
This is code for the following paper:

Preconditioners and Their Analyses
for Edge Element Saddle-point Systems  Arising from 
Time-harmonic Maxwell Equations
(in Chinese:
棱边元离散实谐麦克斯韦方程组的预条件快速迭代解法研究)


There will be four part:
1) EasyMesh and some input/output files;
2) code for finite element method (Edge element, first order Nedelec Element of the first kind);
3) code for iteration method in Matlab;
